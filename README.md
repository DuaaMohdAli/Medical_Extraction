# MedXtract – A Simple Medical File Extractor

Hi! This is a small web app I built using Flask. It lets you upload a PDF or text file and pulls out basic medical info like the patient's name, diagnosis, and medications. It’s meant to be beginner-friendly and easy to use.

## What It Does
- You upload a file (PDF or TXT)
- The app reads the file and looks for keywords like "Name", "Diagnosis", and "Medications"
- It shows you the extracted info in a clean format
